## Planning Story
---
  When I build the Tic-Tac-Toe game project, First, I read the instruction,I look at the API and see what it require and what it response me back, so I can plan to cleate my function that I have to meet the minimum request from this project. Then I start my wireframe for the sign-in sign-up page and when the user click sign-up it will read to the sign-in part, if user sign-in success. User will click the start new game to start the game. I start working on HTML/CSS first, which is not a good idea because it is the easiest part of my project. I already tired after I done my front-end part. Then I move on to start on app.js which is the controller part that contain of the type of event and the function to call when event occur. After that I start my event.js to controll all of the function that will involk when event happened. Here this is my hard part the api.js. I struggle to request the right format to the api. The api response failed many times. The last part is ui.js that adjust anything that will show to the user after request. My project has two part, first one is for user part, second one is for game part. I use a lot jquery to update my user interface. During my code time I face a lot of error I never seen, some error make no sense. Sometimes, I get lost I don't know where I should fix. But this project help me learn a lot. I know one thing, if you cannot find where is the error, just do console.log every part that might cause you and error. I hope you enjoy my Tic-Tac-Toe game.
